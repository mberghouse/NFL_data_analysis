# NFL Game Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to analyze NFL data and predict game outcomes. It leverages AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure AWS credentials for SageMaker access
4. Run exploratory data analysis: `jupyter notebook notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`
5. Train and deploy model: `python src/models/prediction_model.py`

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for data loading, feature engineering, and model training
